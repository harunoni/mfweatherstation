# .Net Micro Framework Weather Station

This project helps you to build a weather station based on .Net Micro Framework. The data come from some sensors (temperature, humidity, luminosity and wind speed) and you can read them, in real time, using a Web page on the integrated Web Server. Enabling data logging, you can save your data into a microSD.

The project is built for Netduino Plus board and based on .Net Micro Framework 4.2 but you can use a different board changing only the pin for the sensors connections.

It uses Metro UI CSS (http://metroui.org.ua/) for Metro style Web page.

The main components are :
* Netduino Plus board;
* Wind Speed Anemometer;
* SHT1X Temperature and Humidity sensor;
* Photoresistor for luminosity;
* DS1307 RTC;
* microSD for data logging;

 The entire kit is also available on Robot-Domestici at the following [page](http://www.robot-domestici.it/joomla/component/virtuemart/stazione-meteo-netduino-plus)
